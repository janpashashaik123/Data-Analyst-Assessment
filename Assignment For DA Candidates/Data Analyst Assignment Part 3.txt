Write a function that accepts a string and returns a mapping (a dictionary or dictionary-like structure) 
that has words as the keys and the number of times each word was seen as the values.

Your function should work like this:

>>> count_words("oh what a day what a lovely day")
{'oh': 1, 'what': 2, 'a': 2, 'day': 2, 'lovely': 1}
>>> count_words("don't stop believing")
{"don't": 1, 'stop': 1, 'believing': 1}

Try to cover as many corner cases possible :)
